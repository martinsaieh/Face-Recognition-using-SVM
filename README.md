# Face-Recognition-using-SVM

In this reopistory you can find basics of svm's how they work and also
bit about kernel trick can be used to perform classification on non-linearly 
separable datasets.

Perks of SVM:
1.Their dependence on relatively few support vectors means that they are very compact models, and take up very little memory.
2.Because they are affected only by points near the margin, they work well with high-dimensional dataâ€”even data with more dimensions than samples, which is a challenging regime for other algorithms.
3.Their integration with kernel methods makes them very versatile, able to adapt to many types of data.
